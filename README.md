# ReactJs Music Player


Implemented various features including Library, Search, Home, and Liked Songs similar to those found in Spotify. Used the Spotify API to retrieve user data.

Utilized Glassmorphism and Neumorphism design to give the application a modern and sleek look.

Users can log in to their Spotify account via the application and access their playlists, favorites and liked songs.

Users can play, pause, skip, and seek tracks, just like in the Spotify app.
